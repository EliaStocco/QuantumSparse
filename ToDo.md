# To Do list

   - script to compute thermal average
   - script to compute thermal average of all spin operators

   - improvements:
      - save operator to folder with matrix elements, eigenvalues and eigenstates as a txt or yaml file

   - create scripts to:
      - plot the spectrum and the DOS
      - compares two operators

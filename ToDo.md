# To Do list

 - improvements:
    - save memory for eigenstates 
    - save operator to folder with matrix elements, eigenvalues and eigenstates as a txt or yaml file

 - create scripts to:
    - plot the spectrum and the DOS
    - compares two operators
    - computes the zz magnetic susceptibility
 
 - workflow for the susceptibility:
    - compute the total Sx, Sy, Sz
    - evaluate the expecation value of the spin_z and spin_z^2 with the eigenstates and save them with the energy to a csv file
    - compute the thermal average
